    ```

Other Files

* conf/global_settings.py: A file that specifies the configuration parameters and hyperparameters.
* analysis.py: Contains functions that help in measuring cdnv (class-distance normalized variance as defined in the paper), accurecies, losses, the level of nearest class center rule.
* utils.py: Contains functions responsible for saving data, loading datasets, etc.
* models: Contains implementations of networks used in training.
